# When Hunger Meets Confusion

Earlier this week, I decided to order dinner using the Uber Eats delivery app. I was craving some wings, but I was not entirely sure from where. My goal was to browse local restaurants and fast food to find something that looked good to me, and then place an order. After a few minutes of scrolling through Uber Eats, I found Wingstop. I found a "8pc Wing Combo Meal" which included 8 wings (two flavors), a side, a dressing, and a drink. I found my order.

After selecting the meal the app guided me through customization steps. First I chose two flavors for the wings. Next I picked fries for the side, and ranch as the dressing. Finally I tried to select a drink. This is where things went wrong. The drink selection box would not respond. No matter how many times I tapped it, the app would not let me choose a drink. And without a drink selection, the app would not let me proceed to checkout.

I tried backing out and reselecting the meal, refreshing and restarting the app, but nothing worked. I realized I could not complete my order and was frustrated. The meal I wanted was unattainable. After spending over 15 minutes trying to order and fix the issue, I gave up. I closed the app and drove to Chipotle instead. While Chipotle was not what I initially wanted, I knew I could rely on their in store ordering process.
